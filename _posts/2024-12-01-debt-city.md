# About the Game

Debt City is a retro sandbox life sim. After things go horribly wrong on an island vacation, you find yourself indebted to one of the most powerful and notorious crime bosses in the seedy Debt City. Given just 10 days to pay off your debt of $10,000, you'll be given the choice: how do you attempt to repay that debt? Will you stay on the straight and narrow and work different jobs to make a living? How about stocking shelves at a convenience store? Or maybe you can be a school janitor? But if that line of work isn't exciting enough.. You can enter the criminal underworld of Debt City. Take assassination contracts to make citizens disappear, no questions asked. Craft and sell specialty (and highly illegal) substances on the black-market. Or maybe you'll become the monster hunter the city needs after a crazed doctor's failed invention goes haywire. But the best part of Debt City? You can do it all. Or none of it. That choice is up to you.

Debt City is all about freedom. With a limited story and a sandbox world to explore, you are able to live your virtual life. Well, at least for 10 days. Each day in Debt City consists of a limited number of actions you can take. Go over those actions, and you will find yourself passing out and ending up in the hospital. With a large medical bill as well, definitely a setback for someone in your situation. Debt City is also about choice. You'll choose from two different characters to play as, you'll choose your apartment style, and you'll also choose your difficulty level. So those number of actions can grow or lessen depending on how hard you'd like the journey to be. And if you die, you'll start over and get to do it all again. But maybe differently this time?

Aside from taking jobs and teetering between being a criminal or doing the right thing, you can also just live your virtual life. Play a minigame on your retro game console in your apartment. Go to the casino and try to win big in your quest to pay off your debt. Go for drinks at the bar. Or just travel back to the island and have a nice vacation. Just remember, you've got 10 days to pay. And there are 4 possible endings to discover.

The 10 day time frame makes the game strategic if you want it to be. But it's not a stressful game. I definitely want a chill vibe. Multiple endings allow you to play forever. And days only advance via certain actions you do in each in-game day. You can play it exactly the way you as the player chose to.
