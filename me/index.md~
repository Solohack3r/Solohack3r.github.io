title: About the Studio
---

aaaaaaSolohack3r Studios is a solo dev studio focusing on retro open world RPGs. All of our games focus on exploration, freedom, and bringing back that retro vibe from gaming classics. Each game is published to Steam for Windows (and Linux via Proton), with Android ports of each game also being made available. Our mobile ports have no ads, no in-app purchases, and can be played offline. That's the way we believe mobile gaming should be.

This studio is the developer behind the video games Knightblade, Neopunk, Beast Slayer, Suramon, Cult of the Dragon, and Debt City.
